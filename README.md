A comprehensive, curated collection of **370+ LeetCode problem solutions** featuring in-depth explanations, complexity analysis, and step-by-step implementation guides.

## Overview

This repository serves as a structured learning resource for developers preparing for technical interviews or looking to strengthen their problem-solving skills. Each solution goes beyond basic code implementation to provide conceptual understanding and optimization techniques.

## Key Features

- **370+ Problems Solved** - Extensive coverage across all difficulty levels and problem categories
- **Deep Dive Analysis** - Detailed explanations of approach, intuition, and thought process
- **Complexity Breakdown** - Time and space complexity analysis for each solution
- **Step-by-Step Documentation** - Clear, guided walkthroughs to understand implementation
- **Multiple Approaches** - Where applicable, multiple solution strategies are discussed
- **Organized Structure** - Easy navigation with descriptive file names

## Problem Categories

This library covers a wide range of algorithmic concepts including:

- **Arrays & Strings** - Two pointers, sliding window, prefix sums
- **Dynamic Programming** - Classic DP patterns and optimization
- **Binary Search** - Search space reduction and binary search variants
- **Trees & Graphs** - Traversals, DFS, BFS, shortest paths
- **Backtracking** - Combinatorial problems and constraint satisfaction
- **System Design** - Data structure design and implementation
- **Database** - SQL queries and optimization
- **Mathematics** - Number theory, geometry, and combinatorics

## Repository Structure

Each problem is contained in its own Markdown file with a descriptive name. Files follow the format:

```
Problem Title.md
```

Example files include:
- `Two Sum.md`
- `Binary Search.md`
- `Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters.md`

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Browse by Problem Name** - Use the file list to find specific problems
2. **Search by Topic** - Use GitHub's search functionality to filter by algorithm type or pattern
3. **Sequential Learning** - Start with easier problems and progress to more complex ones
4. **Interview Preparation** - Review problems by company or difficulty level

## Solution Format

Each solution document typically includes:

1. **Problem Statement** - Clear description of the problem
2. **Approach & Intuition** - Thought process and strategy
3. **Algorithm Steps** - Detailed breakdown of the solution
4. **Implementation** - Clean, well-commented code
5. **Complexity Analysis** - Time and space complexity
6. **Edge Cases** - Important test cases and considerations
7. **Variations** - Alternative approaches or related problems
